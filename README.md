## 👋 Hey, I'm Phil

I’m a Product and UX Designer with over a decade of user-centered design experience, who loves creating innovative digital products with awesome folks. I'm a lifelong creative living in the Midwest with my wife and two awesome children. I enjoy advocating for design thinking and mentoring designers to solve complex problems with elegant solutions. I am captivated by exploring UX in emerging technologies, and relish making things that people actually want to use.
